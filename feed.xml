&lt;p&gt;快速時尚的興起，讓我們隨時都能買到便宜、時尚的服飾，不過你知道一件衣服從製造到穿到我們身上，需要付出多少代價嗎?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;根據英國《時裝商業評論》報導指出，服裝紡織業是全球第二大汙染產業，僅次於石油業。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;每年全球生產約莫 2500 萬噸的棉花，用來製造衣服。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;種植一公斤棉花需要的水量可以讓一個人...泡澡43次 淋浴122次&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還需使用非常大量的化學農藥，對環境造成極大的破壞&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;好像每件衣服都在對你招手？
&lt;br&gt;每件衣服都吸引著你帶它回家？
&lt;br&gt;全部都很喜歡？全部都很想要？
&lt;br&gt;等等！結帳前先問問自己下列幾個問題吧！
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Q1. 是真的需要還是單純想要呢？&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-1.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A：想要 → 去旁邊冷靜一下吧！最後也許會發現自己沒那麼喜歡或是沒有買的必要
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;B：需要 → 為什麼需要呢？把需要的理由好好的分析
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Q2. 那急切程度？&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-2.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A：其實沒那麼急 → 那先暫緩，多思考一下
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
B：十萬火急！今天不買不可！
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Q3. 真的適合你嗎？&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-3&amp;4.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A：朋友或店員說好看，但你其實不那麼認為
&lt;br&gt;
B：覺得哪裡怪怪的、稍微有疑慮
&lt;br&gt;
C：讓你不自在或是無法展現出你的優點 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
→ 放下吧！它不屬於你！
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
D：就像寫著自己的名字，非常合適！
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Q4. 實穿與耐穿性如何呢？&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-5&amp;6.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A：衣服質料不好、質感差、做工粗糙&lt;br&gt;
B：沒有適合的場合可以穿&lt;br&gt;
C：家中沒有其他的單品可以搭配&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;→ 先冷靜考慮一下，避免買回家後悔&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
D：可以穿很久！
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Q5. 價錢是否在預算的範圍內?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-7.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A：超出預算 → 得仔細衡量一下是否真的值得你買下喔！&lt;br&gt;	
&lt;br&gt;
B：沒問題！保護荷包不破產！ 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;購買前的最後小提醒&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2-2/2-2-8.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 檢查是否有污漬、勾線破損等小瑕疵&lt;br&gt;
- 記得了解退換貨的規定，拆標籤前再檢查、試穿一次
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;先放下來等一下&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;為了減少衝動購物，當看到十分想買的東西就先把它放回原位，
給自己大約一個禮拜的時間，如果想買下的心情仍舊很強烈，再將它買回來吧！
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;
